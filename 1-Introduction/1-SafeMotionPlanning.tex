\section{Safe Motion Planning}
In environments shared by both humans and robots, one of the main study
subjects is safe motion planning. Firstly, a path planning algorithm for
decentralized agents able to ensure collision avoidance was proposed in 2008,
and it was proven by using reserved areas~\cite{purwin2008}. Prioritized path
Planning (PP) is one of the main techniques used to plan robotics paths for
multiple agents. It was first explored in 1987~\cite{erdmann1987} and it has
then been refined providing a generally applicable approach without limitations
to the form or degrees of freedom of the robots~\cite{vandenberg2005}. Later on
in 2015, a revi a revised algorithm of PP was presented, proving that if a
solution exists, it guarantees to find a path for every robot to reach the
final destinations~\cite{michal2015}. At the same time, an asynchronous
decentralized algorithm for PP that has been proven to find paths for all the
robots in the system and to terminate twice as fast was also
provided~\cite{michal2015}. Another important factor for human-aware motion
planning is the smoothing of the trajectory which is done by interpolating the
points with well-behaved curves:~\cite{frego2020} proposed a novel solution
using dynamic programming for the multi-point Markov-Dubins problem which was
later refined using parallel programming on GPUs~\cite{saccon2021}. \newline
The integration of human motion in the planning has been studied for
single-agent motion in various works that can then be adapted to a multi-agent
scenario. A first reactive model based on velocity obstacles, i.e., a set of
velocities which the robot should not use to avoid a dynamic obstacle was
proposed in 1998~\cite{fiorini1998}. In 2020, a refinement was presented which
was meant to be applied to multi-agent navigation by using the velocity
obstacle paradigm only for local and reactive navigation, while using RTT* to
generate the global path of each robot, showing a more human-like and
collaborative behaviour of the robots~\cite{boldrer2020}. Another effective
solution was proposed in 2018 using a combination of velocity obstacles,
dynamic windows, that is, a set of velocities easily reachable by the robot
that would allow it to either avoid the obstacle or to stop, and Monte Carlo
sampling to account for the dynamic obstacles~\cite{claes2018}. Other solutions
are based on learning-based methods and predictive planners. The former suffers
from the generalization problem, resulting in troublesome solutions to be
deployed in sensitive environments due to the difficulty in providing safety
guarantees. The latter instead produce human-aware paths if the models are
well-fitted and can rely on precise estimations. Indeed, one of the main
difficulties of multi-agent navigation in environments with the presence of
humans is to find a good model for the human motion. Recent
works~\cite{bevilacqua2018}~\cite{conflict_detection} showed promising results
using headed social force model, i.e., social force model also considering the
direction of the person. In 2019, it has been proved that also the
maximum-entropy model was able to offer safe navigation, for which the human
dynamics are affected by an action drawn from a Boltzmann probability
distribution~\cite{bajcsy2019}.
