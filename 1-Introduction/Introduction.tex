Robots are becoming more and more present in the day-to-day life helping humans
in different aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Industrial: this is possibly the main aspect in which automated
    machines have had the most successful applications. Indeed, the 4.0
    industrial revolution meant for many workers to start interacting with the
    machines present in the factories \cite{industry4_0}, showing great
    results~\cite{coordinationInWarehouse}. One of the most known examples of 
    robotics applied to the industry is Spot from Boston Dynamics, which not 
    only can freely move in the environment and record it with its cameras, but
    when integrated with sensors can find possible problems and predict which
    components will need maintenance~\cite{bostonDynamics}.
  \item Healthcare: for the last decade, robots have started being used with
    great profits in this sector. For example, they have been successfully used
    in precise surgical procedures \cite{surgicalRobot}, in helping impaired 
    and elderly people move \cite{friWalker}.
  \item Search and rescue: robots have been successfully utilized also in
    search and rescue missions in challenging environments
    \cite{searchRescueDrones}.
  \item Office robots:~\cite{cobots}
\end{itemize}
In the majority of this situations, having human-aware trajectory for the
robots to follow, dramatically increases the reliability and safety of the 
environment.
