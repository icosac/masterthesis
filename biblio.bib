   abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time.The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories.The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we study the structure and computational complexity of optimal multi-robot path planning problems on graphs. Our results encompass three formulations of the discrete multi-robot path planning problem, including a variant that allows synchronous rotations of robots along fully occupied, disjoint cycles on the graph. Allowing rotation of robots provides a more natural model for multi-robot path planning because robots can communicate.Our optimality objectives are to minimize the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), and the total distance. On the structure side, we show that, in general, these objectives demonstrate a pairwise Pareto optimal structure and cannot be simultaneously optimized. On the computational complexity side, we extend previous work and show that, regardless of the underlying multi-robot path planning problem, these objectives are all intractable to compute. In particular, our NP-hardness proof for the time optimal versions, based on a minimal and direct reduction from the 3-satisfiability problem, shows that these problems remain NP-hard even when there are only two groups of robots (i.e. robots within each group are interchangeable).},

Also unique are the chapters discussing how graphics hardware can assist in collision detection computations and on advanced optimization for modern computer architectures.

   abstract = {Heuristic searches such as the A* search are a popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality, simplicity in implementation and consistent behavior. In planning for robotic manipulation, however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based approach to motion planning for manipulation that does deal effectively with the high dimensionality of the problem. Our approach achieves the necessary efficiency by exploiting the following three key principles: (a) representation of the planning problem with what we call a manipulation lattice graph; (b) use of the ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality; and (c) use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics. The paper presents the approach together with its theoretical properties and shows how to apply it to single-arm and dual-arm motion planning with upright constraints on a PR2 robot operating in non-trivial cluttered spaces. An extensive experimental analysis in both simulation and on a physical PR2 shows that, in terms of runtime, our approach is on a par with other most common sampling-based approaches despite the high dimensionality of the problems. In addition, the experimental analysis shows that due to its deterministic cost minimization, the approach generates motions that are of good quality and are consistent, in other words, the resulting plans tend to be similar for similar tasks. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human controlling or interacting with the robot.},

In this paper, we deal with the problem of finding a trajectory for each such relocation task that avoids collisions with other robots. The chosen robot plans its trajectory so as to avoid collision with other robots executing tasks that were issued earlier. We prove that if all possible destinations of the relocation tasks satisfy so-called valid infrastructure property, then this mechanism is guaranteed to always succeed and provide a trajectory for the robot that reaches the destination without colliding with any other robot. The time-complexity of the approach on a fixed space-time discretization is only quadratic in the number of robots. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented method on several real-world maps and compare its performance against a popular reactive approach that attempts to solve the collisions locally. Besides being dead-lock free, the presented approach generates trajectories that are significantly faster (up to 48% improvement) than the trajectories resulting from local collision avoidance.},

   abstract = {The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.},
