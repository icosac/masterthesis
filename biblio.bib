   abstract = {&lt;p&gt;        Most games being shipped today use some form of high-level abstraction such as a navmesh or waypoint graph for path planning. These structures can generally be represented in a form which is compact enough to meet the tight memory constraints in a game. But, when such a graph grows too large, finding paths can still be a complex task. This challenge was faced in Dragon Age: Origins and solved by adding an additional level of abstraction.In the last few years a variety of novel approaches have been developed for finding optimal paths through graphs with specific design applications for road networks. Currently these techniques cannot be feasibly applied to the lowest detail of movement possible in a game map, but can be applied to the high-level abstractions which are commonly found in games.In this paper we describe the pathfinding challenge faced before shipping the title Dragon Age: Origins and perform a postmortem analysis on the extended abstraction that was used in comparison to building more advanced heuristics or the use of contraction hierarchies. We show that contraction hierarchies and abstractions have similar overhead and performance and are both useful approaches for high-level planning in games.      &lt;/p&gt;},

   abstract = {We consider a system consisting of multiple mobile robots in which the user can at any time issue relocation tasks ordering one of the robots to move from its current location to a given destination location. In this paper, we deal with the problem of finding a trajectory for each such relocation task that avoids collisions with other robots. The chosen robot plans its trajectory so as to avoid collision with other robots executing tasks that were issued earlier. We prove that if all possible destinations of the relocation tasks satisfy so-called valid infrastructure property, then this mechanism is guaranteed to always succeed and provide a trajectory for the robot that reaches the destination without colliding with any other robot. The time-complexity of the approach on a fixed space-time discretization is only quadratic in the number of robots. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented method on several real-world maps and compare its performance against a popular reactive approach that attempts to solve the collisions locally. Besides being dead-lock free, the presented approach generates trajectories that are significantly faster (up to 48% improvement) than the trajectories resulting from local collision avoidance.},

In this paper, we consider point-to-point requests that come with source-destination pairs and release-time constraints that restrict when each request can be served. The point-to-point requests and release-time constraints model taxi rides and deliveries. For all the variants considered, we show constant-factor approximation algorithms based on a linear programming framework. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first set of results for the aforementioned variants of the minimum latency problems. Furthermore, we provide an empirical study of heuristics based on our theoretical algorithms on a real data set of taxi rides.},

   abstract = {Recent work on the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) has begun to study agents with motion that is more complex, for example, with non-unit action durations and kinematic constraints. An important aspect of MAPF is collision detection. Many collision detection approaches exist, but often suffer from issues such as high computational cost or causing false negative or false positive detections. In practice, these issues can result in problems that range from inefficiency and annoyance to catastrophic. The main contribution of this technical report is to provide a high-level overview of major categories of collision detection, along with methods of collision detection and anticipatory collision avoidance for agents that are both computationally efficient and highly accurate.},

   abstract = {The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.},

   abstract = {The Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem is the funda-
mental problem of planning paths for multiple agents, where
the key constraint is that the agents will be able to follow
these paths concurrently without colliding with each other.
Applications of MAPF include automated warehouses and
autonomous vehicles. Research on MAPF has been flourish-
ing in the past couple of years. Different MAPF research pa-
pers make different assumptions, e.g., whether agents can tra-
verse the same road at the same time, and have different ob-
jective functions, e.g., minimize makespan or sum of agents’
actions costs. These assumptions and objectives are some-
times implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes
it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in
research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. This
paper aims to fill this gap and support researchers and prac-
titioners by providing a unifying terminology for describing
common MAPF assumptions and objectives. In addition, we
also provide pointers to two MAPF benchmarks. In partic-
ular, we introduce a new grid-based benchmark for MAPF,
and demonstrate experimentally that it poses a challenge to
contemporary MAPF algorithms.},
