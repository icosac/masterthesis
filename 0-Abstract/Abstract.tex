\chapter{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}
Robotics is emerging has being one of the most critical aspects of the
industrial revolution, allowing for improvements in various scenarios. In
particular, in this thesis we will focus on the motion planning for multiple
robots with a real warehouse located in the center of Italy as the main
scenario. \newline
First, we start with a description of the state-of-the-art algorithm used to
solve the \acrf{MAPF} problem, showing their strengths and their weak spots.
\newline
Then, we move to the description of three algorithms we have implemented to
tackle the aforementioned problem explaining the modification we had to make to
the algorithms in order to be able to use them in our scenario. \newline
The description of the tests created to examine their characteristics follows.
Moreover, we explain how we divided the warehouse map in order to create tests
of increasingly difficulty. \newline
Finally a discussion on the results and the future work that may come with it
is carried out.
